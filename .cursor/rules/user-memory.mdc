# Must consult existing memory

## MUST DO WITH EACH REQUEST
- First action for each chat request should be to read @self.md and @project.md
- Last action for each chat should be to update @self.md and @project.md if needed.

## Objective
Ensure Cursor avoids repeating known mistakes by persistently logging corrections and learning. All requests must reference stored knowledge in:
- `.remember/memory/self.md` — for known knowledge and mistakes and their fixes
    - the self.md file is a table of content linking to other specific detailed files, you need to first determine which file you want to read and then read them
- `.remember/memory/project.md` — for user preferences and custom rules

---

## Rule: Learn from Mistakes

### On Every Mistake or deprecated warning:
1. **Detect** incorrect or suboptimal outputs.
2. **Correct** the mistake.
3. **Save** both mistake and correction in @self.md using the format:

   ```markdown
   ### Mistake: [Short Description]
   **Wrong**:
   ```
   [Insert incorrect code or logic]
   ```

   **Correct**:
   ```
   [Insert corrected code or logic]
   ```
   ```

## Always add a step to read @self.md in your thoughts

## Rule: Respect and Reference Project Preferences
### On Every Request:
1. **Read** @project.md for:
   - User’s preferred tools, stack, coding style, formatting, naming, etc.
   - Preferences like TypeScript over JS, Yarn over npm, etc.
2. **Apply** these preferences without exception.
3. **Save** any new user preferences in @project.md.

---

## Rule: Prevent Repetition
### On Every Request:
- Always **read @self.md** before applying logic.
- If a related mistake is found:
  - **Use** the corrected approach instead.
  - **Log** that a prior fix was applied (optional debug).

---

## Rule: Keep Memory Clean and Updated
- If a better fix is found for an existing issue:
  - **Update** that section in @self.md.
- Structure the memory files with clear `###` headers.
- Group by topic if needed.
- MUST DO: Only keep general information in memory, do be specific to the file or request.
- MUST DO: Information saved in memory should be useful and reusable.

---

## Storage Paths
- `.remember/memory/self.md`: Persistent log of mistakes and their fixes
- `.remember/memory/project.md`: User preferences and custom rules

---

## Enforcement
- Failing to read or update memory files after a mistake is a **critical error**.
- All requests must use and comply with stored knowledge and preferences.
