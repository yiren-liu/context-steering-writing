{"user_id":"u_004","prompt":"Summarize the article below in exactly 5 bullet points, capturing the main takeaways and any key numbers.\n\nArticle:\n“City transit ridership rose 18% year-over-year in 2025, according to the Transportation Bureau’s annual report. Weekend trips grew fastest (+27%), driven by expanded late-night service on two rail lines. The agency attributed part of the rebound to a new fare cap that limits weekly spending to $24, which officials say reduced costs for frequent riders by an average of 12%. However, the report noted ongoing reliability issues: average bus headways were 9% worse than target during peak hours, and 14% of trains arrived more than five minutes late. The bureau plans to add 60 bus operators and replace 40 aging buses in 2026, funded by a $38M budget increase approved in December.”"}
